<b>Tic Tac Toe </b> - simple game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

This simple app is written in Java, using Java Sockets. Firstly you have to run server (ServerMain.java), which will be listening on localhost and port 8999.

After that we can run our clients (ClientMain.java) - every client separately. 


<b>Requirements:</b>

Java 1.8
